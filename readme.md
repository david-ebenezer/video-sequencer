# Video Sequencer

Hey there, welcome to Video Sequencer! This tool is your buddy when it comes to syncing up footage and timestamps. Here's a laid-back guide to get you started:

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies**: Begin by installing the necessary dependencies with `pip install pyautogui`.

2. **Format Your Timestamps**: Make sure your timestamps match the format in `TIMESTAMP.txt`.

3. **Set Up Shortcuts**: Get cozy with the keyboard shortcut layout in `AUTOMATIONLAYOUT.kys`.

4. **Sync Your Footage**:

   - First, line up your mixed recording footage with the timestamps.
   - Then, mesh your mixed recording with the original footage for that perfect harmony.

5. **Fine-Tune Cursor Position**: Use the Timeline Controller to tweak your cursor's X and Y positions with `TIME_X_POSITION` and `TIME_Y_POSITION`.

6. **Trim the Fat**: Turn off tracks you don't need, like `v1`, `v2`, `a1`, `a2`, and so on. Keep it lean and mean.

7. **Adjust the Delay**: Make small adjustments to the delay until everything lines up like magic.

8. **Run main.py**: Time to hit the big red button and let `main.py` work its magic.

## Just a Heads Up

- Feel free to jazz up the settings and scripts to match your style and needs.

Have fun with Video Sequencer! ðŸŽ¥âœ¨
